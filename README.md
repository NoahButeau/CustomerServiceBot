# GOAL
The goal is to create a customer service bot using OpenAI and Kafka. At the moment the project uses a tkinter window to display the conversation but a website using flask is in development and soon testing on the website to test how much load it can handle. The thought process behind using Kafka was to be able to scale this customer service bot to be able to handle a large number of users. Pairing the customer bot with kafkas low latency pub/sub to provide quick reponse to the users is a no brainer.
